#Leadership Summit - Code of Conduct

##Purpose

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all attendees of Mozilla's Leadership Summit, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, age, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

We invite all those who participate in the Leadership Summit to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

## Encouraging and Recognizing Participation

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase meaningful collaboration by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on all our summit participants.

Intentional, positive action is essential to avoid replicating within our summit community the many forms of inequality that exist in greater society. For this reason, we outline in this Code of Conduct expected behavior as well as prohibited behavior.

If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our summit community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, recognize them for their good work either personally or by letting event organizers know directly or by email to [participation@mozilla.com](mailto:participation@mozilla.com).

##Expected Behavior

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all summit participants, including attendees, speakers, and staff:

* Participate in an authentic and active way.
* Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
* Attempt collaboration before conflict.
* Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
* Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert an event organizer / Participation Team member if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.
* Be mindful that for many, English is a 2nd, 3rd or even 4th language, and to show patience and respect while listening to and conveying ideas.
* Remember that we come from many cultures and backgrounds. What is friendly in one culture may not be in another. 
* Remember that due to personal, religious, or other reasons, not everyone in the group may drink alcohol. Please respect people’s choices and preferences in this regard without question or criticism.
* Be mindful of local laws, and protect each other from making public - personal information that may put people at risk of appearing to violate those laws.
* Remember that summit venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.


##Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable:

* Violence and threats of violence.
* Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm.
* Derogatory comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, age, or socio-economic status.
* Sexual images or behavior.
* Posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying information (“doxing”).
* Deliberately referring to someone by a gender that they clearly do not identify with.
* Capturing photos or recordings that might embarrass, shame or exploit an individual or group.
* Physical contact or simulated physical contact (e.g. textual messages like “hug” or “backrub”) without affirmative consent.
* Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments or jokes; inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcomed sexual advances.
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).
* Sustained disruption of summit events, including talks and presentations.
* Influencing the over-consumption of alcohol, or making derogatory comments about those who abstain from alcohol.
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any summit community participants, including those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If an event participant engages in unacceptable behavior, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the event, as well as associated and future events without warning.


## Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify the summit conduct team as soon as possible by emailing [leadership-summit-conduct@mozilla.com](leadership-summit-conduct@mozilla.com)

Additionally, event organizers are available to help summit community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context of in-person events, organizers will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.

##Addressing Grievances

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify the summit conduct team at [leadership-summit-conduct@mozilla.com](mailto:leadership-summit-conduct@mozilla.com)
with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our existing governing policies.

## Scope

All summit participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; contractors; and other guests) are expected to abide by this Code of Conduct in all summit community venues—online and in-person—as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to summit community business.

This Code of Conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of summit community activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of summit community members.
