We chose a manifesto in order to capture the many complex elements of our participatory mission.\r\n\r\n1. Participation is when people can freely contribute their energies, time and ideas to support Mozilla’s mission\r\n2. In order to keep the web open and participatory it must be shaped by organizations, like Mozilla, who are equally open and participatory\r\n3. Participation is at the core of Mozilla’s history and identity and provides a key advantage for Mozilla as an organization\r\n4. Participation cannot exist without a culture of openness that allows contributors the opportunity to shape and build Mozilla’s programs and products at every level\r\n5. Participation must provide value for both Mozilla and Mozillians (participants)\r\n\r\n## Contact\r\nIf you'd like to propose new work or get in touch with the team, head over to [discourse](https://discourse.mozilla-community.org/c/participation).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
