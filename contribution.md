## Contributing!

* Familarize yourself with [Heartbeat](https://heartbeat.mozilla.community/), which acts as a UI to the issues in this repository.   
* Our 3-week Heartbeat process is based on the one used by Webmaker, and they have a [great page explaining how we work](http://book.webmaker.org/heartbeats.html).
* To get involved you can add your name in the comments section of any issue, specifying the way you think you can help.  You can also ask questions this way.
* We also have a [special tag: 'volunteer'](https://github.com/mozilla/participation-org/labels/Volunteer%20Task) tag which identifies tasks that either provide contribution opportunities, or are themselves a volunteer task.  Volunteer tasks will often provide prerequisites and participatoin steps to getting involved.
